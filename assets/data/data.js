While their bodies can naturally develop the antibodies that they need to fight off common illnesses, vaccinations can prevent these diseases, along with its complications, from happening in the first place.`,

		title: "Common vaccination concerns",
		content: `Parents may have several concerns about their child‚Äôs immunization schedules. The top concern being the frequency of these shots which may give them the notion that their child is getting too many at the same time. Vaccines do not overload a child‚Äôs immune system and can help protect your child from as many as 14 different childhood diseases. Getting your child vaccinated will not cause autism.`,

You should always do your best to show up at your child‚Äôs vaccine appointments and never alter his/her immunization records to avoid confusion.
